# todoapp
This is a simple and interactive Todo App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks easily. It features a clean and modern user interface with a gradient background and responsive design. The app uses JavaScript to dynamically manage tasks and store them in the browser’s localStorage, ensuring that tasks remain saved even after refreshing the page. This project demonstrates the basic concepts of DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage in JavaScript, making it a great beginner-friendly CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application.
